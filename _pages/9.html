              Vapes are battery-operated devices that heat vaping liquids (known
              as e-liquid) into an aerosol. The aerosol is inhaled and absorbed
              into the bloodstream while the remaining aerosol is exhaled.
            </p>
            <p>
              Youth may think vaping is harmless, but it is not! Vaping poses a
              significant and avoidable health risk. E-liquids often contain
              harmful chemicals, chemical flavouring and nicotine that can
              produce negative health effects. Nicotine is a highly addictive
              and harmful substance that can interfere with the developing teen
              brain. Nicotine use in adolescence can affect memory,
              concentration and increases the risk of future addiction to other
              drugs.

              As a parent, it is important to have early, open, and honest
              conversations with your teen about the risks and harms of vaping.
              Here are a few helpful tips to get the conversation started:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-v-align">
              <li>
                <b>Know the facts</b>. Take time to learn the facts about vaping
                and the related risks to physical and mental health.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Build a trusting relationship with your kids</b>. Be
                supportive and show that you care. Having a trusting
                relationship goes a long way when it comes to kids listening to
                your messages and coming to you for help without fear of
                punishment.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Encourage open conversations</b>. Be open, non-judgmental and
                understanding. Try to find a natural time to discuss vaping, for
                example when you see someone vaping.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Help your kids plan ahead for social situations</b>. Practice
                refusal skills they can use with their friends in situations
                where vaping is likely to be offered.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Know where to get help</b>. It’s important for your child to
                have trusted adults, aside from you, in their life that they can
                talk and go to for help (such as a school social worker, school
                child and youth counselor, health care provider, or

              Did you know that just like reading and writing, children need to
              learn to move? Basic movement skills include; skipping, jumping,
              kicking, throwing, running and catching. When children learn basic
              movement skills they feel confident trying a variety of physical
              activities because they have the skills to succeed and have fun.
            </p>

            <p>
              Finding opportunities to help children develop basic movement
              skills will give them the tools they need to make healthy choices
              and grow into happy, healthy, and active adults. Regular physical
              activity can improve your child’s physical health, brain function
              and mood.
            </p>

            <p>Here are some tips to help children develop movement skills:</p>
            <ul class="list-v-align">
              <li>
                Be active as a family – Parents are their child’s first and best
                teacher!
              </li>
              <li>
                Help children see physical activity as a normal part of their
                daily routine – try walking, cycling and wheeling to school.
              </li>
              <li>
                Be a good role model – Children watch and learn more from what
                you do than from what you say.
              </li>
              <li>
                Encourage children to participate in organized sports, drop in
                activities or school teams that are appropriate for their age
                and skill level.
              </li>
              <li>
                Set daily screen time limits to help your child create a healthy
                balance between technology and being active.
              </li>
              <li>
                Set time aside for “unstructured play”- get outside and explore
                nature.

              Oral health is a key part of your child’s overall health and
              well-being.
            </p>

            <p>
              When your child enters junior kindergarten, they will have about
              20 primary (baby) teeth. Soon after, your child will experience
              mobile (wiggly) teeth. Around age 6, permanent adult front teeth
              will begin to come in and replace the fallen baby teeth, but some
              may experience it sooner or later.
            </p>

            <p>
              Around the same age, their permanent adult first molars will begin
              to come in. These do not replace any primary (baby) teeth. This is
              a good opportunity for you to show and observe your child brushing
              all the way to the back of their mouth so that food or plaque are
              not missed on the new molars. This is a common area for cavities.
            </p>
            <p>Here are some oral health tips:</p>
            <ul class="list-v-align">
              <li>Brush twice a day for two minutes</li>
              <li>Floss once a day</li>
              <li>
                Help your child brush and floss until approximately the age of
                seven
              </li>
              <li>Visit the dentist/dental hygienist regularly</li>
              <li>Eat healthy foods</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If you have concerns about your child’s oral health, schedule an
              appointment for your child to see a dentist.

              <li>establish healthy eating routines</li>

            <p>Check out these great tips:</p>

            <ul class="list-v-align">
              <li>
                <b>Make a plan.</b> Plan your meals and snacks ahead of time,
                this helps to make healthier choices, saves time and reduces
                stress when grocery shopping or preparing your meals on busy
                nights.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Involve children in meal preparation.</b> Children who help
                make meals are more likely to enjoy and eat it too!
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Be flexible with meal timing.</b> When children are involved
                in sports or programs during mealtimes, plan to eat your meals
                when most of the family can be there. You can also take a
                breakfast, lunch or dinner as a “meal-to-go” and eat together at
                the park, arena, pool or gym.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Enjoy “family-style” meals.</b> In family-style meals, offer
                food in larger bowls or serving dishes. This style of meal
                allows everyone to serve themselves and eat food based on their
                hunger cues and food preferences. Everyone can see what is
                prepared and select what and how much they want to eat.
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>Include cultures and food traditions.</b> This creates a
                sense of community, fosters connection and keeps your cultural
                roots and traditions alive. Try to explore community events that
                celebrate with cultural foods, cook foods from diverse cultural
                backgrounds and share family recipes and traditions with others.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b> Put away distractions.</b> Distractions such as TV,
                electronics and toys can take away from mealtime. Without these
                distractions, your family can enjoy eating, talking with each
                other and help everyone be mindful of their food choices.

              Mindfulness is a life skill that can help reduce stress and
              anxiety, manage symptoms of mental illness, and improve overall
              health and well-being. It is training the muscle of attention;
              learning to be present in the moment and directing our attention
              with an open mind.

              <b>Some ways to practice mindfulness include:</b>

            <ul class="list-v-align">
              <li>
                Eat a meal without distractions like TV or any other devices.

              <li>
                Go for a walk and pay attention to the environment around you

              </li>
              <li>
                Take a moment to notice what you are thinking and how it makes

              As a parent, try to role model and practice mindfulness with your
              child. With practice, you and your child can learn to be present,
              making way for a calmer approach to all aspects of life.

              Resilience is commonly thought of as the ability to ‘bounce back’
              when faced with a challenge. It helps us to cope with our feelings
              so we can learn from an experience and move forward. For a child
              this could mean; having a disagreement with a friend, failing a
              test or not making a team.

              since the brain continues to develop until the age of 25. This can
              also put your teen at risk for unintended injuries and violence.
              Some commonly used substances include alcohol, cannabis, nicotine,
              opioids and other illegal drugs.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a parent or caregiver, it is important to have early, open, and
              honest conversations with your teen about the harmful effects of
              substances. Here are a few helpful tips to get the conversation
              started:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-v-align">
              <li>
                <b>Know the facts</b>. Take time to learn the facts about
                commonly used substances and the related risks to physical and
                mental health.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Build a trusting relationship with your kids</b>. Be
                supportive and show that you care. Having a trusting
                relationship goes a long way when it comes to kids listening to
                your messages and coming to you for help without fear of
                punishment.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Encourage open conversations</b>. Be open, non-judgmental,
                and understanding. Look for natural opportunities to talk to
                your kids when you have their attention (e.g. when driving
                together in a car).
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Help your kids plan ahead for social situations</b>. Practice
                refusal skills they can use with their friends in situations
                where substances are likely to be offered.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Know where to get help</b>. It’s important for your child to
                have trusted adults, aside from you, in their life that they can
                talk and go to for help (such as a school social worker, school
                child and youth counselor, health care provider, or

              Instant messaging, social media, e-mail, and gaming have made it
              easier than ever to share a joke, post a thought, or send a photo
              between friends or to a large audience. But problems arise when
              technology is used to harass, humiliate, intimidate and threaten
              others. This is known as cyberbullying.

            <ul class="list-v-align">
              <li>
                Talk to your child about internet safety. Discuss online
                high-risk behaviour and create “what if” scenarios together to
                help your child recognize dangerous situations and practice
                responses.

                Participate with your child online. Let your child teach you

                Monitor your child’s online activity by keeping devices in a
                busy area of your home.
              </li>

              <li>
                Regularly check your child’s “followers” for new and unknown
                names.
              </li>
              <li>
                Remind your child not to say anything online they would not say
                in real life.
              </li>
              <li>

              Biking is a fun and healthy activity that can be enjoyed by the
              whole family. It is also a fantastic way for kids to include
              physical activity as part of their daily routine. For example
              being active by biking to school.

              Parents play an important role in preparing their child to ride a
              bike, and ensuring they wear a helmet safely. Follow these tips to
              help increase your child’s safety while biking:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-v-align">
              <li>
                <b> Have your child always wear a helmet.</b> When helmets are
                worn properly they can reduce the risk of serious head injury.

              </li>
              <li>
                Identify your child’s asthma triggers (e.g. dust, mould, strong

                School Board protocol is for students to carry their own
                inhalers or have them easily accessible. A number of variables
                may need to be taken into consideration (age of the student,
                maturity, etc.). Agree on a plan with your child’s teacher.
              </li>
              <li>
                Review field trip forms and ensure asthma medication is with
                your child on the trip.
              </li>
              <li>

              study habits, time management and problem solving skills. Homework

            <ul class="list-v-align">
              <li>
                <b>Demonstrate interest</b> – Have routine discussions with your
                child about what they are learning and doing at school. Foster a
                positive learning environment at home.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Provide time and support for daily homework </b> – Support
                your child’s learning both at home and at school. For older
                children help set priorities for school work and out of school
                activities (this may include extra-curricular activities,
                leisure time and chores).

              <li>

                – Identify ways to communicate between you, your child and your
                child’s teacher to support effective communication. Participate
                in parent information nights, volunteer activities, arts and
                sporting events, school council or the school board’s parent
                involvement committee.
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>Stay informed </b> – Read about school updates and activities
                in the school newsletter, website or social media. Provide
                updated contact information to the school to ensure you receive
                notice for activities, events, attendance and reporting updates.

              Mental health shows in how you think, feel and act in life. It
              affects how you see the world, handle challenges, relate to others
              and make choices. Mental health is about having a balance in your
              life between your social, physical, spiritual, emotional and
              economic needs. Every day we face challenges to our mental health.
              However, we can take steps to lessen stress and find our balance
              again.

              As parents, we want to give our children opportunities to
              participate in extracurricular activities. However finding a
              balance between scheduled and free time is also important.
            </p>
            <p>
              The constant rushing to activities can increase stress levels for
              both parents and children. Overscheduled children can be tired and
              miss opportunities for creative play and making friends. Children
              and parents deserve to have empty spaces on their calendars. This
              balance will allow everyone to slow down, feel less hurried, and
              enjoy life at their own speed.
            </p>
            <p>How do we slow down?</p>

                Exercise is a known stress-buster. Going for walks or bike rides
                as a family will help build positive relationships and make you
                all feel good. Also, families who eat together tend to have
                better nutrition and talk more to each other.

              During times of change or starting new routines, children may show
              more intense reactions to separation. Common signs of separation
              anxiety are crying and clinging when you leave. This is normal.
              Being sensitive to your child’s feelings and working to provide
              reassurances for them will help the transition.
            </p>
            <p>Helpful tips to deal with separation anxiety:</p>
            <ul class="list-v-align">
              <li>
                <b>Develop a regular morning routine -</b> wake your child up
                early so the morning does not feel rushed. Make time for a
                healthy breakfast and drop your child off at a consistent time
                each day.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Always say goodbye - </b> let your child know you are leaving
                and you will always return. Tell your child when you will return
                in concrete ways he or she can understand. “Mommy is going now;
                I will pick you up after school.”
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Develop a regular goodbye ritual - </b>
                choose something that is comforting for your child. Blowing
                kisses, a hug, or waving good-bye can be reassuring for your
                child during separation.
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>Show confidence - </b>Tell your child they will be will be
                okay and they can handle this. Link to the next time you will be
                together “When we get home tonight, we will play at the park
                before dinner”
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Exit quickly and without hesitation - </b> goodbyes are
                easier if the parent is decisive and calm.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              As your child gets more comfortable with their new school
              environment, they will find it easier to settle into the day and
              adjust to a new routine.

              Self-regulation means responding to life’s stressors, and
              returning to a calm and alert state, ready to deal with new
              circumstances. These skills develop gradually throughout the
              lifespan and parents play a huge role in helping their children

              All of us experience negative events in our lives. Pets die, best
              friends move away or we don’t make the team we tried out for. We
              can’t always prevent these things from happening, but resilience
              will help us to cope positively.
            </p>
            <p>
              While there are many definitions of resilience, it is commonly
              thought of as the ability to ‘bounce back’ when faced with
              adversity. Rather than being overcome by sadness, anger or other
              negative thoughts, resilience helps us to cope with our feelings
              so we can learn from the experience and move forward.
            </p>
            <p>How do children develop resilience?</p>
            <ul class="list-v-align">
              <li>
                The single most common factor for children who develop
                resilience is at least one stable and committed relationship
                with a supportive parent, caregiver, or other adult.
              </li>
              <li>
                Children need to feel that they belong; having strong
                relationships at home and in your community is a good place to
                start.
              </li>
              <li>
                Children need to be able to rely on you; this lays the
                foundation for building trust in future relationships. For
                example: if you see your child struggling with their homework,
                help them break the problem down into something more manageable.
                Not only does this give you a chance to connect with your child,
                it builds resilience so that they are able to cope with bigger
                issues later in life.

              A healthy diet is very important for good oral health. Eating
              healthy foods, following Canada's Food Guide , and limiting sugar
              consumption will help reduce the chance of tooth decay, cavities
              and gum disease.
            </p>
            <p>
              Examples of snacks that increase the risk of tooth decay or
              cavities:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-v-align">
              <li>Drinks high in sugar i.e., juice or soft drinks</li>
              <li>
                Soft, sticky or hard foods i.e., raisins, toffee or gummies
              </li>
              <li>
                Starchy snack foods i.e., cookies or crackers if eaten regularly
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Examples of snacks for good oral health:</p>

            <ul class="list-v-align">
              <li>Water is the drink of choice</li>
              <li>Vegetables, hummus, cheese and plain yogurt</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              By following these tips, you can help your child develop healthy
              eating habits and promote good oral health at the same time.

              Have you ever stopped to look at your child’s life from their
              perspective? A lot of demands are placed on your child such as
              homework, extra-curricular activities, chores and relationships.
            </p>
            <p>
              1 in 5 children will struggle with poor mental health. Stress is
              often a contributing factor. For children, stress can have a
              negative impact on their school work, self-esteem, ability to
              communicate with others and relationships with family and friends.
              Research shows that prolonged stress in children can also affect
              brain development.
            </p>
            <p>
              Parents play an important role in teaching children how to manage
              their stress.

                <b>Be a good role model.</b> Show your children healthy ways you

              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Maintain routines as much as possible.</b> Morning routines
                get the day off to a good start while bedtime routines help
                children relax. This is often the time when children will want
                to chat about their day.

                <b>Check in with your child frequently.</b> Ask about things

                <b>Limit extra-curricular activities.</b> Running from activity

                <b>Reserve free time.</b>A calendar can help your family stay
                organized. If you are having trouble finding down time, schedule
                it in.

                <b>Teach children words to describe their emotions. </b>
                Use words such as "I feel angry" or "I am sad when this
                happens," or "I'm afraid." Problems have feelings attached and
                children who can talk about their feelings can solve their
                problems better.

                <b>Teach your child stress management techniques. </b>
                For example deep breathing, positive self-talk, doing a fun

              We all want our children to reach their full potential. Search
              Institute has identified 40 positive supports and strengths that
              young people need to succeed. These are called Developmental
              Assets.
            </p>
            <p>
              The more assets a child has, the less likely they are to engage in
              high risk behaviour and the more likely they are to thrive. Assets
              are divided into two categories: Internal assets and external
              assets.
            </p>
            <p><b>Internal assets</b></p>

            <ul class="list-v-align">
              <li>Commitment to Learning</li>
              <li>Positive Values</li>
              <li>Social Competencies</li>
              <li>Positive Identity</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>External assets</b></p>
            <p>
              External assets are developed through connections with others in
              their school, at home and in the community.
            </p>

            <ul class="list-v-align">
              <li>Support</li>
              <li>Empowerment</li>
              <li>Boundaries and Expectations</li>
              <li>Constructive use of Time</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We all play an important role in building assets in children.</p>
